- This classification model aims to predict the type of bean based on multiple predictor variables such as area, perimeter, major axis length, minor axis length, aspect ratio, as well as other discusses below. For this model, we will be utilizing the UC Irvine dry bean dataset found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset. From the Dry Bean Dataset, our data analysis aims to develop a classification model for predicting the type of dry bean using 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms. To enhance the model's efficiency, we will initially reduce the number of variables, selecting those most relevant to our predictive question and those that maximize our models accuracy power. Subsequently, we will assess the dataset by dividing it into training and testing sets to optimize prediction accuracy and model performance. With the optimized K value, we will construct a model utilizing specific variables to predict bean types, supported by various visuals, such as accuracy versus neighbor count, under/overfitting plots, and assessments of irrelevant predictors.
- After the selection and reduction of predictors we got an accuracy level of 88.9%, but after tuning the k value, we were able to raise the accuracy level to 89.4%. Through comparing accuracy of the model using a range of numbers of predictors we found accuracy ranging from 68.1% to 87.1% (seen in Table of Accuracy given Number of Predictors).
